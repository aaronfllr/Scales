This little project allows you to enter the tuning of a stringed instrument, the key, and the scale that you would like to see. This then returns the fretboard with notes on it to help visualize the layout of the notes. 

The Requirements are a current version of matplotlib. 

Scales/modes currently available:
    "major" 
    "minor" 
    "dorian"
